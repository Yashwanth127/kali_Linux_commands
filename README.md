# Kali Linux Commands Notebook

Hi everyone   
This is a simple notebook I created while learning and practicing **Kali Linux**.  
I wrote down all the important commands that I use for basic Linux operations, networking, user management, and ethical hacking tools.

I made this to keep everything in one place and to help others who are also learning Linux or cybersecurity.
